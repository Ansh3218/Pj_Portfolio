Over the years, I’ve worked with 50+ clients from different corners of India ( and a few abroad too ) Most of my projects revolve around films and content creators both short and long form but I’ve also collaborated with businesses, and I’m looking to expand more in that space. One of the highlights of my journey so far has been a short film I created that went viral across multiple social media platforms, crossing millions of views and 1.1 Million+ on my own YouTube channel.

At the end of the day, for me, editing isn’t just about cuts, transitions, or effects it’s about shaping emotions, simplifying complex ideas, and creating videos that leave a lasting impact.
